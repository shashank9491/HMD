It wasnt like a World Cup semifinal or something. It was just a tri-series. A series where Australia had already beaten us before this game. But this was Sachins night. This was our night and for all those in the stands and those staying up at night, ignoring everything else to watch pure class.

He won the World Cup, innumerable Man of the Match and Series awards, scored the first-ever ODI double ton, made the highest number of centuries, the highest number of runs, most caps for the country... he did it all. Every landmark justified why we call him God.

But this one, this innings was different. This one was like no other. Tendulkar will be remembered for many things, but Sharjah will always be special. We witnessed God in his prime that night.
